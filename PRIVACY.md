# Privacy Policy for Sidebar for Arc Users

## Data Collection

This extension does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

## Local Storage

The extension stores the following data locally on your device using Chrome's storage API:

- Pinned sites (URLs, titles, custom icons)
- User preferences (font size, icon size, display settings)

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to the developer or any third party.

## External Services

The extension connects to Iconify API (api.iconify.design) solely to fetch icon images when you customize pinned site icons. No user data is sent in these requests.

## Bookmarks and Tabs

The extension reads your Chrome bookmarks and tabs to display them in the sidebar. This data is only used for display purposes and is not stored or transmitted.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted in this repository.
