## Description

Arc Browser like Pinned Sites, Bookmarks and Active Tabs in Side Panel

I missed Arc's sidebar after switching to Chrome in how Arc puts favorites, bookmarks, and tabs all in one vertical list. So I built this extension to bring that experience to Chrome.

- Bookmarks/Pinned sites become persistent tabs, just like Arc
- Click to open, click again to switch to it
- Close the tab without losing the bookmark
